\title{Calculate Spatial betweenness}
\usage{
spat_betweenness(graph, alpha, rank = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{igraph object with V(g)$X and V(g)$Y having the X and Y co-ordinates of each node.}

\item{alpha}{specifies alpha value at which betweenness is to be calculted}

\item{rank}{decides whether to return rank of nodes of raw values. Defaults to TRUE meaning ranks are to be calculated}
}
