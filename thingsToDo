How to make it work:
1. Removed importing check_spatial_clustering function
  This is causing an error as Kest cannot be imported from spatstat. Probably spatstat was updated
2. Need to expose flattening ratio
3.Need to update sp to sf
  Probably will fix 1
4. Change data.table to tibble (dplyr)
  Will work for most things. Only some things are using data.table specific aggregation functions
